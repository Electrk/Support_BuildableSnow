#### <a name="api-create-grid"></a>`BuildableSnow_CreateGrid (width, length, height[, useAsync[, asyncCallback]]);`

Creates the WxLxH grid of snow bricks, either synchronously or asynchronously.

| Argument | Type |  Description  | Default Value |
| -------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
| width  | integer | | | |
| length | integer | | | |
| height | integer | | | |
| useAsync | boolean | _(Optional)_  Use async method of creating the grid using schedules.  Calls `asyncCallback` when finished. | false |
| asyncCallback | string | _(Optional)_  Function to call when grid creation is done. | |

##

#### <a name="api-destroy-grid"></a>`BuildableSnow_DestroyGrid ([useAsync[, asyncCallback]]);`

Destroys the snow grid, either synchronously or asynchronously.

| Argument | Type |  Description  | Default Value |
| -------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
| useAsync | boolean | _(Optional)_  Use async method of destroying the grid using schedules.  Calls `asyncCallback` when finished. | false |
| asyncCallback | string | _(Optional)_  Function to call when grid destruction is done. | |

##

#### <a name="api-raise-snow"></a>`fxDTSBrick::raiseSnow ();`

Flattens brick if it's not already; raises snow brick above if it is.

##

#### <a name="api-lower-snow"></a>`fxDTSBrick::lowerSnow ();`

Lowers snow, provided there's no snow above this brick.

## <a name="error-handling">Error Handling

If a function returns a value indicating some sort of issue (usually `false`, an empty string, or `-1`), you should check `$BuildableSnow::LastError` to see what error occurred, if any.

Here are all the errors:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::None | There was no error and the operation was successful. |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::Generic | Reserved for possible future use.  Currently unused. |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::NotSnowBrick | The brick we're trying to operate on is not a snow brick. |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::HasSnowAbove | The brick we're trying to operate on has snow above it. |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::NoSnowBelow | The brick we're trying to operate on doesn't have the supporting snow required. |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::InvalidGridPos | Attempted to use an invalid grid position. |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::BrickNotFound | No brick was found at this grid position. |
| $BuildableSnow::Error::CreateBrick | There was an error with `createBrick()` â€” check `$CreateBrick::LastError` |

This add-on uses `Support_CreateBrick.cs`, which has its own errors with `$CreateBrick::LastError`:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| $CreateBrick::Error::None | There was no error and brick creation was successful. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::PlantOverlap | "Overlap" plant error. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::PlantFloat | "Float" plant error. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::PlantStuck | "Stuck" plant error. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::PlantUnstable | "Unstable" plant error. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::PlantBuried | "Buried" plant error. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::Generic | There was some miscellaneous/unspecified error creating the brick. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::DataBlock | Attempted to create a brick with an invalid/nonexistent datablock. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::AngleID | Attempted to create a brick with an invalid angle ID. |
| $CreateBrick::Error::BrickGroup | Attempted to create a brick with a nonexistent brick group. |
